# Session 4

In the dark of night Cyrus snuck off after deciding that our party would never deliver a fortune worth his time. In the afternoon that followed, Raz, Drusilla and Gumpy visited a necromancer's university by broom and were attacked by zombies. Gumpy bravely gave his life so they could flee on the broom. He may or may not now be a zombie dwarf.

After they returned to the rest of the party in the tower they give them the news of Gumpy's death. While telling their story, a large portal suddenly opened in the sky. Out of it climbed Drake Goldmember (Paladin) and Alleis (sp? Warlock), he a golden dragonborn god and she a highly literate and cunning wizard of ?.

After a brief introduction with them the party realized that the castle had quietly emptied of most of its former occupents. We suspected they had fled through the portal. After some debate about who was joining who's party it was decided that we should venture through the portal. In a show of unity of youthful excitement everyone held hands stepped through the portal together.

They emergend to find themselves in a tavern filled with angels, demons and weird creatures. Drake confronted the man who sent him through the "one-way" portal and in exchange for not being pummeled he offered up inforation. This information was that we were in an interdimensional 'crossroads' and there was an individual who knew the location of a portal and key that would return us to the City of the Dead in Shitworld. It was unclear why our heroes wanted to visit the city of the dead, or even reaturn to their shitty world, but whatever. Because she couldn't resist Raz pickpocketed an angel and managed to steal a wooden mobius strip. Nobody got murdered.

We headed off to a ziggurat factory (unclear if it was a factory in a ziggurat, or one that produced ziggurats) run by the Garys who knew the location of the portal. One Gary always lied and one was always truthful. Both Garys are part of the same person somehow. En route Aelar purchased a stunning golden metallic shirt with platinum sheep. He wears it half unbottoned gracefully displaying his chiseled physique.

After arriving at his face shaped factory of gears we talked our way past a flesh wearing killer bird of a bodyguard (by pretending we were called Gary and had an appointment, which somehow worked) and we were brought to the office. In the office we met the Garys and discovered which Gary was not lying through a cunning ruse of asking their name. Truth-Gary offered the location of the portal and its key but suddenly Lies-Gary (nicknamed Larry) insisted he be paid a petrified mouse for this task. Randomly (or related?) Gary's girlfriend was a type of Medusa named Yselda. He gave us her location and went to meet her at the Sensatorium (some magical Oculus Rift arcade-like thing).

She was not allowed to petrify anything while at work, and did not get off work for a few hours. To speed up the process, we agreed to deliver a new job application for her in exchange for petrifying the mouse. So off we went to the Center for Insectoid Accountancy to deliver a job application for a receptionist position. After meeting a worker ant we were led to a Sr Ant Accountant who had a beard and a 3 candled hat. He (I think?) accepted the job application (by swallowing the voice-ball) and even offered Yselda the job. Then we were able to unwind the stack. We returned to Yselda with good news. She petrified a mouse for us. We took it to the Garies, who finally told us the portal's location and its key (the previously stolen mobius strip). We went to the portal and opened it. In contrast to the first time, this time Aelar farted and everyone jumped through the portal after him.

On the other side of the portal we were in the middle of the desert near what we assumed was the city of the dead. There was a thin layer of crystal sand on the ground an a ruined decaying city in front of us. Drusillia spoke with a snake and discovered there were underground tunnels with pale skinned human creatures living in them. There was rumors of an underground city. We went to investigate and found a long sloped slanted tunnel which we then debated about how to enter. Drake suddenly leapt in and Alleis and Aelar left after him, at which point everyone else jumped in.

We slipped and found ourselves dropped into a large dark underground conical chamber with a blood alter in the center. We opened one of the adjacent doors and found small a creature which attempted to dash away. Raz, Fear, and Alleis reacted quickly to slay the creature before it could run away. The room had a large statue to a tentacled god standing over the door and there appeared to be an alter near the center, surrounded with benches. Raz snuck into an adjacent room and saw 17+ small fleshy creatures hiding apprehensively (what were they hiding from?). She re-emereged to let us know then walked back to door and launched a firebolt into the room. This coupled with some other spells attracted the attention of a larger man with a snake-covered-stick that attacked Fear after emerging into our room from a secret door. After blocking the burning room using some benches we killed the man, mainly through a fierce godly blow from the hammer of Drake.
