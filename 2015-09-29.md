# Session 4

In the dark of night Cyrus snuck off after deciding that our party would never deliver a fortune worth his time.
In the afternoon that followed Raz and Drusilla and Gumpy visited a necromancers university by broom and were attacked by zombies. Gumpy bravely gave his life so they could flee on the broom.

After they returned to the rest of the party in the tower they give them the news of Gumpy's deaath. While telling them a large portal suddenly opened. Out of it climbed Drake Goldmember and Alleis (sp?), he a golden dragonborn god and she a highly literate and cunning wizard of ?.

After a brief introduction with them the party realized that the castle had quietly emptied of most of its former
occupents. We suspected they had fled through the portal. After some debate about who was joining who's party it was decided that we should venture through the portal. In a show of unity of youthful excitement everyone held hands stepped through the portal together. They emergend to find themselves in a tavern filled with demons. Drake confronted the man who sent him through the "one-way" portal and in exchange for not being pummeled he offered up inforation. This information was an individual who knew the location of a portal and key that would return us to the City of the Dead in Shitworld. Because she couldn't resist Raz pickpocketed an angel and managed to steal a wooden mobius strip.

We headed off to a factory run by the Garys who knew the location of the portal. One Gary was lieing and one truthful. En route Aelar purchased a stunning golden metallic shirt with platinum sheep. He wears it half unbottoned gracefully displaying his chiseled physique.

After arriving at his face shaped factory of gears we talked our way past a flesh wearing killer bird of a bodyguard and we were brought to the office. In the office we met the Garys and discovered which Gary was not lieing through a cunning ruse of asking their name. Gary offered the location of the portal and its key but suddenly Gary insisted he be paid a petrified mouse for this task. Randomly (or related?) Gary's girlfriend was a type of Medusa named Yselda. He gave us her location and went to meet her at the Sensatorium (some magical Oculus Rift arcade-like thing. We agreed to deliver a new job application for her in exchange for petrifying a mouse. So off we went to the Center for Insectoid Accountancy to deliver a job application for a receptionist position. After meeting a worker ant we were
led to a Sr Ant Accountant who had a beard and a 3 candled hat. He (I think?) accepted the job application and evened
offered Yselda the job. The we were able to unwind the stack. We returned to Yselda with good news. She petrified a mouse for us. We
took it to the Garies, who finally told us the portal's location and its key (the previously stolen mobius strip). We went 
to the portal and opened it. In contrary to the first time this time Aelar farted and everyone jumped through the portal after him.

On the other side of the portal we were in the middle of the desert near what we assumed was the city of the dead. There
was a thin layer of crystal sand on the ground an a ruined decaying city in front of us. Drusillia spoke with a snake
and discovered there were underground tunnels with pale skinned human creatures living in them. There was rumors of an
underground city. We went to investigate and found a long sloped slanted tunnel which we then debated about how to
enter. Drake suddenly leapt in and Alleis and Aelar left after him, at which point everyone else jumped in. We slip and
found ourselves dropped into a large dark underground conical chamber with a blood alter in the center. We opened one of
the adjacent doors and found small a creature which attempted to dash away. Raz, Fear, and Alleis reacted quickly to
slay the creature before it could run away. The room had a large statue to a tentacled god standing over the door and
they appeared to be an altern near the center with benches. Raz snuck into an adjacent room and saw 17+ small fleshy
creatures hiding apprehensively (what were they hiding from?). She re-emereged to let us know then walked back to door
and launched a firebolt into the room. This coupled with some other spells attracted the attention of a larger man with a
snack stick that attacked Fear after emerging into our room from a secret door. After blocking the burning room using
some benches we killed the man, mainly through a fierce godly blow from the hammer of Drake.
