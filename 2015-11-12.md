# 11/12 D&D Summary - The Wrath of Zargon

After killing the man with the snake staff, we entered the other door in the room. It was a squalid dwelling with a ratty bed, a smashed open chest (empty) and some other junk. There was a quivering, bedraggled white skinned red-eyed creature (same as the ones we left to burn in the other room). He meekly surrendered, and we questioned him.

His name was Zin (we nicknamed him Xander) and he was an unwilling servant of the High Priest of Zargon, the man we just killed. He was elated when we told him we had set him free. Zargon is an old god, who lives in the ancient city of the gods far below. The statue we saw in the entrance to this area was of Zargon, the tentacled cyclops with a jeweled horn and rubies for eyes.

Zin told us he could lead us down into the depths to Zargon, and that we were his new masters. We lied to him about burning his friends, and said the door had been barred since we got there. Aelar made a show of attempting to un-bar the door, failing his strength check. Drake stepped in and removed the obstructions. The room was still on fire, with the awful smell of burning flesh. Zin wept. We decided to wait for the fire to subside as it was only straw, furniture, and bodies burning (not the stone walls or floor). We closed the door and went back to the statue. Anais put her hand near the statue's mouth, and barely got away as it magically closed on her.

Zin told us they used to feed the statue sacrificial flesh. We fed it the body of the High Priest, one piece at a time (Anais did the carving). It spoke to us in a gravelly, disembodied abyssal voice (which Fear understood) and thanked us for a worthy sacrifice, but did not respond to questions. Then Drusilia pried one of its ruby eyes out. It screamed at us, and as we argued and fought about trying to put it back, the ceiling caved in. Only Anais was dexterous enough to jump out of the way for half damage, the rest of us took 32 damage, with Fear falling unconscious. Drake recovered him from the rubble with a Lay on Hands, and we took a short rest to recover. Drusilia learned her ruby was worth about 500gp. Unfortunately, Zin was crushed in the rubble and died. We were on our own again.

Luckily the destruction had put out the fire, so we proceeded through the burnt room and down a staircase. There was a wooden door that was stuck shut, which Drake noisily smashed open with his hammer. There were two paths: north and east. Aelar noticed that there were more tracks leading north. Fear and Anais were perceptive enough to read some runes in Undercommon on the wall that said "Ladder", "Shoes", and "Death" pointing north. We decided to follow the north path.

Drake smashed open another door and inside we saw 4 armored white skinned creatures - like Zin, but less gaunt and more muscular, with swords and crossbows. They had 18 AC so it was quite a battle. Anais threw many eldritch blasts, Drusilia created a spike growth on the ground and later turned into a dire wolf, Aelar performed quite the flurry of sword attacks, Fear cast all of his mighty spells, and Drake stood in front trying not to die and occasionally connecting with his warhammer. When there were just two left Anais tried to convince them to surrender, but they succeeded a morale check and swore vengeance for their fallen. After much heroics all around and killing all but one of them, the last one surrendered and offered to help us. The guard was a servant of a merchant, but had not been paid yet so he was not overly loyal. We discovered the merchant in the room cowering behind an upturned table. We noticed three ladders leading down in the room, and two other doors.

In an attempt to gain information, Drake threatened the merchant with his hammer, Aelar felt him up, and Anais went straight to torturing with her dagger. After he refused to tell us where his treasure was, she removed 3 fingernails and went to work on removing his teeth (you'll note a dagger is a clumsy tool for dentistry). He still refused, and seemed not to fear death. Finally, Fear cut off one of his fingers (and Anais tended to the wound in a confusing turn from bad cop to good cop), and he gave in. He told us his name was Zade. He had treasure in many dungeons. He led us back to a hidden room and lied about it being full of traps when we threatened to kill him. He finally opened up a treasure chest for us, revealing about 3790gp in various coin, 4 gems worth 50gp each (zircon, rose quarz, 2 carnelian), a potion of superior healing, a potion of fire giant strength, and a vellum containing a scroll of Hold Monster (5th level warlock spell). We distributed teh phat lootz (sic).

We asked a bit more about Zade. He owns this whole level, on which he has a harem and storerooms of grain and alcohol. Aelar bolted for the harem like an elf in heat and shacked up with two male and two female creatures (the same white-skinned red-eyed race, which we learned are called Cragorak (sp?)), while also taking mushrooms. We asked Zade to read the runes near the entrance for us, and he told us that it says two of the ladders lead to death traps and one doesn't. He claimed the middle was safe, but when we asked him to lead the way and go first he relented, it had been yet another lie. They all lead to death, he said, and the entrance to go below is hidden in his storerooms. He said it's many levels down to old elven city where he scavenges most of his treasure, and the next level down is run by the army. He also said there is no such thing as Zargon, the statue is driven by cheap magic.

Finally he suggested that instead of trying to fight our way through, he can pass through freely as a merchant. If we pose as his servants (or guards?) and he bribes a few people, he should be able to get us through without a fight. We asked the other guard if he was telling the truth, and he said for once he was. We decide to leave them both alive while we ponder our next move.
