# Session 6 - Zargon's Downfall

The party awoke from their rest to find Drake Goldmember had vanished. Anais had been left a note, saying something. Drusillia started wearing less and going out more.

The party decided we could trust the merchant (Zade), but did not want to pretend to be his slaves. Instead, they agreed to pose as his bodyguards to gain passage to the underground city. He told the party to stop being such dicks or nobody would believe the ruse. The other guard (Zander?) also came along.

He led them down several levels, past a guard post and some barracks. Against all odds, Aelar, Drusillia and Anais actually passed their checks and the guards were fooled.

The next level down was a bar/cantina. The party immediately bought drinks and started chatting up the locals, which angered Zade since they were supposed to be being inconspicuous. They left the bar without incident.

On the next level down, a trapdoor led to a long ladder down to the city. The party was apprehensive, but went down after some assurances from the guard. At the bottom of the ladder was a square room with several doors, gargoyles that were obviously going to come to life in each corner, and a pile of slime in the middle. The party set fire to the slime, which was flamable. The gargoyles seemed inert (great rolls, team!), so the party headed to the next room, similar to the first but contain ghouls and ghasts. They were dispatched quickly, with the help of the guard (who was no help at all, but at least he tried). At the point, the predictable gargoyles came to life and attacked the party. Although stronger, they were also killed quickly. To avoid future gargoyle action, the party smashed the remaining insert gargoyles into little pieces.

Moving into another room, the party came face to face with Zargon, the supposedly fictional god. The party was unable to gloat about it to Zade, as he was immediately killed in a cave in, along with the guard. Unlike the earlier zargon-cavein, fear did not get knocked unconcious.

A pitched battle was joined and the heroes regretted their lack of any resting after the previous fight - hit points were low and spell slots all used up. Drusillia used her dire wolf form to great result, and Daar and Raz landed some powerful blows. It was touch and go, with several party members falling unconcious a couple of times, but in the end the party were victorious, taking down all 150 HP from the god. Some gold was found, along with a few magic items; A +1 shield for Fear, a cursed scroll that breifly turned Anais into a tiny cute version of Zargon and some otehr things I forgot.

Then a portal suddenly appeared and a figure from the nexus stepped out. He explained that they had been watching the party and deemed them worthy to help save the multiverse. This seemed like a pretty good idea, since they were all out of ideas for saving shit-world, and getting off this world would mean they could finally spend some gold. They stepped through the portal and were transported to a forest on the outskirts of a town. The party rested and made some purchases...
