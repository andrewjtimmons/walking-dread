# Session 1

The game started as we were fleeing the sinking island of don’t remember. It was the (literal) seat of the undead lich 
king who ruled the world. He’s been in charge for thousands of years. About a hundred years ago he destroyed the heart 
of the world (not sure what this is) and the world has been dying since. His magical island (made of metal) just sunk 
into the sea. We escaped with other refugees on a minotaur boat. We rowed the boat to the nearest port, the city of 
Brightbell, where we were dropped off. The world looks something like this:

The world is divided into 4 regions, each ruled by a vampire duke. The duke’s lands in turn are ruled by undead death-knight 
lords. The lich king can control huges numbers of undead, using his magical ‘focus’, his throne. The dukes and lords can also 
control undead via their focuses, which are crowns and such. They have undead armies of mind-controlled zombies, skeletons, 
etc.

Our minotaur boat landed at Brightbell and we got off, along with a family (husband, wife, 2 kids) and a bachelor. We had 
heard of Brightbell before (maybe?) and knew it was said to have a magical bell that allowed time travel.

The docks were oddly deserted and the boat had left. We were heading west towards the gate to the city (it’s surrounded by
a 100ft stone wall, punctuated with towers), but visibility was low due to for and we were suspicious. We hung back and let
the family go on ahead of us. We soon heard screams and the sound of people being torn apart. Gumpy (lucas) ran after them, 
saw there were a pack of 4 zombies, so tried to run away quietly. He rolled low and instead made a big racket. Combat ensued.
The zombies were super tough, but we killed them in the end through some big hits from ??? (merci) and ??? (megan). 
Drusillia (haley) was badly wounded and fell unconscious during the fight, but was healed by Fear (cal). After combat, we
searched the bodies of the family and the zombies and got some gold and gem (from zombie intestine). Fear then murdered the 
bachelor. Someone spoke to a seagull (probably Drusillia) and learned they were people in the city still baking bread (so 
probably not zombies since they don’t eat food).

Drusillia searched the beach and found lots of dead bodies of humans and zombies (i think?), so piled them all up and burned 
them. We couldn’t easily continue around the wall (there were cliffs), so opted for trying the door. A regular knock did 
nothing, but a loud magical lock bought guards to the top of the wall, who eventually let us in.

Inside the city, we found food being rationed and the people downtrodden. We spoke briefly to the captain of the guard and 
found out the city had been under siege from a crazy undead army to the south for 2 weeks. The lord (name?) who ran the city 
and (previously) controlled the army had not been heard from in those 2 weeks. We schemed of ways to get into the lord’s
compound to the south west. The guards would let us out the door and lower the bridge to the fort, but then we’d be on our 
own, close to the mindless army.

We tried fucking with the bell in the center of the city, but it did nothing. If was super shiny though and had some kind 
of aura.

Through his underground contacts, Cyrus (shalom) found out about a secret tunnel entrance across the bay. We constructed 
a raft from the boat wood smashed to make barricades, then spent a day waiting for nightfall in the city. During this time, 
??? (ben) spent waay too much on a pint of ale (everything is expensive in the city as they run out of food & drink), 
several of us failed to con our way into free ale, and cyrus stole the lockbox from the tavern and got the gold back.

That night we crossed the bay under cover of darkness. Drusillia (i think) found the secret passageway entrance cut into 
the cliff-face and it revealed an underground river leading towards the lord’s compound. We followed the river to a basement,
where the rogues snuck around to find we were below an empty, abandoned kitchen. We explored the attached main hall, finding 
a pile of dead and mutilated servants. Exploring the rest of the compound we found lots of dead undead soldiers, their 
livery showing them to be from several armies. There was a pitched battle here.

There were a couple of undead horses in the stable. They were dicks though. There were some war machines in the courtyard 
(ballistas, catapults and trebuchets). We went up the body-filled stairway to the lord’s tower, which was smashed up but 
body-free. One of the rogues (?) found a hidden door which revealed a small room with a teleport circle on the ground.

We left the compound via the underground river, but not before stealing 5 barrels of fancy wine (aged for more than 100 
years) from the basement, to make some money.

At some point someone told us the city was built over an ancient dwarven city. That might be something to investigate. 
The secret tunnel seemed to be made by dwarves (good stonework).

Arriving back in the city, we talked to the captain of the guard without telling him everything. The liveries of the 
soldiers matched the troops of the armies camped south of the city (don’t remember which colors were which armies). Seems 
likely the lord lost control of his armies and they turned on him, but he escaped via teleporting. We asked the captain 
about teleport circles, and he told us to go to the wizard’s building, in which they were holding a conference.

We showed up there to a big black building with no door and then a door appeared. Not sure what we did to make that happen. 
It was bigger on the inside than the outside. Inside were a ton of wizards from various magic schools (don’t remember the 
colors). They were mostly dicks.

They told us things about teleport circles and basically we can’t find out anything about the one in the lord’s tower 
(we did not tell them anything about the lord though). We were trying to trick the headmaster into doing something for 
us to do with teleportation, but failed. He had a circlet he wore as his magic focus, that bit Gumpy when he tried to 
steal it. They said the bell used to work, but has not for centuries. Something to do with it being dangerous to travel 
through time because you affect the future. Not sure if the implication is that the lich king did this and fucked stuff 
up, or if we are supposed to do it and fix things.

We didn’t leave with a great plan to move forward. We can’t easily leave the city to the south, but we have a raft. We 
might be able to trick/pay the wizards to teleport us somewhere. We have lots of wine to sell too.


## Future Plans

* Release zombies into city or castle and loot town. Probably also search inside corpses.
* Escape via boat to the north or south
* Try and find out more about surrounding area from wizards
* Find hidden dwarven dungeon by talking to people
* Throw the town a party with our wine
  * After everyone is drunk, open the gates?
  * Get the wizards drunk?
