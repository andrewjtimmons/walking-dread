# Session 9 - The underground river

With no particular goal, our heroes explored downstairs in Jolliver's room and found an underground stream running west to east. The eastern end let out into the main river, but the other way led deeper underground. The group set off up the stream and quickly ran into a group of ghouls. Combat ensued, which involved a lot of falling into the water. After they ghouls were dispatched, the group traveled west, into a giant grotto, where they found no interesting traps or secrets. They were surprised by a pair of small water elementals, who they killed easily. Traveling further west, they could see the entrance to an old dwarven temple, with people milling about outside the door.

Some of the people got into a boat and started heading towards the (still concealed) party. The party quickly backtracked to Jolliver's room and laid a trap for the group in the boat. After some time, the group in the boat failed to show up. The party went back down the stairs, but they were nowhere to be seen; maybe they went out to the river, or maybe they turned back to the temple. The party set off again towards the temple.

There was a group milling about on the steps, smaller now, with just 5 people. The party decided to do some bluffing, which usually ends well. They claimed that there had been a slaughter at the temple (true), and that some kind of fire cult was responsible (not true). They also claimed that they were initiates of the water cult and that they had been sent for help. The folks on the platform did not readily believe this, and the leader went through the big magical door to do talk to someone. Some kind of discussion happened, during which somebody said something wrong and a fight broke out. The party murdered everyone on the platform, but the gate had been locked behind the leader when they went inside. Without a key on any of the bodies, the heroes were unsure what to do next.
