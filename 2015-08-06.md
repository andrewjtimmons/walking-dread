# Session 3

Very brief summary is that we ended up lured into a witches lair in the swamp. There we killed one witch and forced another 
to flee a fairly epic battle that involved lots of swing and miss actions. There was *lots* of treasure in the lair so we 
all divided that up, then Fear also took the skin off of the witch and Chandler took one their eyes for reasons. Daar 
got a magical axe and Gumpy acquired a flying broom. Then we rafted down river to the capital which was also overrun by 
zombies. There we found a small group of roughly 40 soldiers holed up in a fortress who seemed pretty resigned to dying there
after their lord lost control of the zombies while he was gone to see the lich king. Charizma, Gumpy, and Raz flew on the broom
to the first of two interesting locations in the city a necromantic wizarding school. The wizards there seemed quite resigned 
and were basically about to go to sleep for 20,000 years to wait out the zombies. He did tell us that via some magical 
incantations on the lich king's throne it was theoretically possible to recharge the magic of the time traveling bell. I think 
here we got shown a map of the region too which included a city of dead in the middle of the desert.
