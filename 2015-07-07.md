# Session 2

2 new characters joined us for our second session:
* Charizma Sugatitts, race class, played by Anna
* Chandler Kittenstouch, rcae class, played by Brad

We started still inside the university, where the wizards were having some sort of conference. After dubbing them the 
University of Dick Wizards we vowed to probably kill them somehow in the future. We left with no clear plans. Exiting was 
straight forward - we just walked out the door.

* everyone levels up (2)
* slaughtered dog
* aelar flirts with dwarf bar keeper (buying a fancy ale for 1g)
* the rest of the party pay 1c per ale - there is a suspicious amount of it
* fear says hello to another teifling (just passing through)
* cyrus find a theif and learns the secret hand signal
* raz sneaks down a spiral staircase behind the bar to investigate the room below - find giant beer vat and a secret door. dwarven stonework
* the rest of the party use the hand signal to gain access to the stairs
* explore around the basement
* come upon 4 guards (city watch colors, clearly theives guild too) playing dice
* gumpy wins a game is up 3 gold
* gumpy loses a game where the guard bet his armor, loses 75g
* ask the guards about the beer - the bar keeper just stockpiled it
* guards leave, heading back to the tavern
* we investigate the 4 doors - the first is a bidet that gets torched
* we find underground sewers, one of which leads towards some light
* we find a giant dragon fountain
* we come upon more theives, and ask them to take us to the theives lair (for some reason)
* they tell us that the fountain has a pedal to pump water
* we get escorted to the theives hq, boss theif does not take kindly to us being there (~30 theives there)
* we do some bluffing and calim to be a theives guild travelling from the original city
* we offer some fancy wine in exchange for him helping us get out the city (and not killing us)
* rax and cyrus go off to fetch one of the 5? barrels, and bring it back to the lair
* guild boss is impressed, makes 2 theives escort us out the city
* we emerge from the tunnels several hundred yards beyond the zombies
* we murder the thieves to "send a message" or something
* we then travel south, away from the zombies, before camping for the night - nothing eventful happens
* the next day, we travel east towards a lake
* when we get there, we find a village of ~300, deserted
* upon close inspection, the villageers have all been mauled to death, likely by zombies
* we search all the bodies and get a good pile of gold
* we go to sleep in one of the houses, keeping a watch
* during the night, there is a thick fog
* out of the fog come 3 skeletons - we start combat, with merci taking a surpise attack round
* as the combat progresses, 15 more skeletons appear from tghe fog, along with a giant zombie minotaur
* cyrus gets knocked unconcious, but drusillia heals him
* gumpy turns into a bear to tank the minotaur and takes crazy damage, being smashed through the wall of the house we were sleeping in
* he turns into a bear again and takes a ton more damage again. drusilla turns into a dire wolf for the same reason
* fear uses turn undead, which causes 6 skeletons to turn and run
* chandler does a double 2 handed attack with his axes, but hits only once in 4 attempts, then only doing 4 damage
* with everyone attacking, the remaining skeletons and minotaur are defeated and the fleeing skeletons mopped up
