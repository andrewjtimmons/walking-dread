# Session 7 - A new purpose

Our party walked around the town of Red Larch and met Azaghal (who was that?). They learned of a delegation from Mirabar that went missing when travelling south from Beliard. With nothing better to do, they planned to loop around and head north up the same road to try and discover what had happened to the delegation.

The party headed south along The Long Road toward bargewright inn, which smelled of shit, where they met a half-elf named Nalaskur Thaelond, who told them about the area and the smuggling that goes on there. They persuaded him to keep an eye out for magical items, especially rings.

Travelling east across the bridge over the dessarin river into Womford, the party happened upon an unsavory lot near the docks by their keelboat (with oars). The boat had a weird wymbol painted on the side that seemed to mean something to do with water. Fear appoached the leader of the group, a genasi (water being) to try and find out more, but it went poorly and the oarty attacked them instead. They slayed the lot of them, including the genasi, leaving one wounded survivor. The survivor revealed that the symbol was from a water cult and that they had travelled south down the river from Rivergard Keep, where they had been transporting slaves. The party tied the survivor to the boat, set it on fire and pushed it out into the river. They then relaized that the townsfolk had been watching the whole time and were now terrified. The party slept in an inn, without any further harassment (since everyone thought they were insane monsters).

The party headed north along the dessarin road and happened upon a group of reavers and bandits, with one priest bearing the same symbol on his robe. After dispatching most of them in a quick fight, they questioned the final surviving bandit, who told that he worked for the water cult, also known as the Crushing Wave, and that its leader was called Jolliver Grimjaw. He identified the location previously marked on the map as Rivergard Keep. The party stopped to rest while planning their next move.
