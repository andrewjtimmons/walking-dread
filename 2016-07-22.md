# Session 13 - A less fun Burning Man

After sleeping quietly thorugh the night our party heads back to the road where we find the tracks of the party that had been following us the previous night. We decide to follow their tracks and eventually come upon a party of druids on the road ahead of us. Raz decides to cloak us in what he mistakenly believes to be a spell that will grant us invisibility. He then casts ghostly hand to grab the ass of one of the druids hoping to spark a disagreement among the party. It turns out we aren't invisible and when they turn around after having their ass grabbed they just see us standing there. AWKWARD.

We end up getting past the whole ass grabbing thing and they inform us that they are staying at the keep to witness the burning of the wicker man. This is a festival that they have been invited to, the other camps we saw are likely other independent groups who were also invited. We decided to head back to their camp with them (Camp 1).

We arrive at their camp in the morning and things are generally peaceful and we mingle with the druids. Aelar decides this isn't the part atmosphere that he expected of a wicker man ceremony and hits the brandy quite hard. After a failed attempt to cut Aelar off he is banned from the camp and wanders off and passes out. With Aelar out of the picture the rest of the party is able to make friends. Daar travels the other camps and finds:

* Camp 6 - asleep
* Camp 3 - 2 humans, not druids and very suspicious of druids
* Camp 4 - waved over Daar but turned out to be dicks - "Wickerman is not a part it is a ritual. It is a sacrifice" (Aelar offered his liver). The burning seems much more ominous now.
* Camp 5 - An elven woman with 2 dancing sprites. Daar meets (and flirts with) Galiana the elf. She shares our concerns about nefariousness.

The rest of the party heads up to the main wickerman area (near the keep) and see a 2 story tall wicker giant standing there. There are two guards on the scaffolding and two priests that are praying in robes that resemble those of the fire priests we previously fought.

Aelar awakens in the evening and we all head up to the keep for the burning of the wickerman. We find it already lit at the base and there seem to be preparations for it to burn through the night. Aelar and Raz leave the party, deciding to sneak into the keep and steal some stuff while the wickerman burns.

Shortly after they leave a priest appears and declares: "there are few among you that should not be here". In response to this announcement Camp 4 moves on Camp 3 and attempts to apprehend them. In a surprising twist Camp 3 turns into wolves to defend themselves but are subdued. After they have been apprehended they are led into a butt-hole entrace to the now aflame wickerman. Galiana, who had previously expressed her misgivings to Daar, casts a spell and disappears in a puff of smoke.

As this is happening Raz and Aelar approach the wall outside the keep. As they try and scale the walls steathily Raz stumbles hopping off the wall and the guards on the tower notice them. The guards at first don't realize what is happening as Raz ignores their command to leave. He then casts a spell of fire illusion on the scaffolding they are standing on. As one of the guards rushes down to put out the fire Aelar sneaks up to kill the guard. In a moment of irony that hints at divine intervention the guard rushing down stumbles and shatters his latern setting fire to the scaffolding.

Back at the site of the wickerman the fire is spreading and the priests are engaging in some chanting that seems to be growing. Drusillia approaches some of the druids she met earlier and expresses her concern at the situation. They are receptive and agree to support us if this situation becomes more dangerous. As if on queue the wickerman becomes alive and lurches towards some of the druids Druisillia had been speaking to. It reaches out with it's huge burning wooden arms and strikes at one of the druids killing them immediately. Dar, Drusillia and Azaghal prepare to battle the wickerman and the priests that have summoned it. Drusillia quickly casts a wall of water spell that divides the area of the battle and it along with the fire-proof robes they had previously acquired proves to be a life-saver in ensuing fireball filled battle.

Back at the keep Aelar quickly dispatches the stumbling guard and with some help from Raz they finish off the remaining guard on the tower. As Aelar and Raz rush back towards the battle they are subjected to a hail of fireballs which knock Aelar unconcious. Raz looks at him on the ground briefly before continuing on towards the battle.

While they rush across the courtyard the wickerman is focused primarily on the druids that Druisillia had convinced to support us. The Azaghal and Druisillia are focused on killing priests and other members of the cult while Daar is heroically attacking the wickerman with her great axe. As the battle begins to turn in our favor some allies of the cult sneak away and finally Daar lands a killing blow on the wickerman.

As the party (finally) heals Aelar and prepares to venture into the tower he observes that the guard with th hell hounds they saw while sneaking to the tower appears to be missing...
